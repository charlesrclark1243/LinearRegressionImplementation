# LinearRegressionImplementation

As someone who is hoping to work in the tech industry as a data scientist one day, I felt it important to understand how machine learning algorithms are implemented in Python. I decided to start with linear regression because it is the algorithm I am most used to as an Applied Math major. This implementation follows the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation technique to minimize the error in the model. The PDF file shows the mathematics behind my implementations of both simple linear regression and multivariable linear regression; I learned these derivations in some statistics and econometrics courses I've taken. The fit method also gives the user the option of estimating the bias (intercept) term. I'm hoping to implement the Logistic Regression model next.
